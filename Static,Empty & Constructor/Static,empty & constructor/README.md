## Static block

**Static blocks** are executed at the time of class loading which are executed before running the **main ()** method.
* Only **static variable** can be initialized in static block.
* It can used for initialization purpose when the application is starting.

## Empty block
* Empty block will be called when we are creating the object with new keyword without the object will not get execute. 
* Both static and not static variable can be initialized in empty block.

## Constructor
* Constructor will be executed while creating an object in Java.
* The name of a constructor must be always the same name as a class.
* Here also constructor will be called when we are creating the object with new keyword without the object will not get execute.

## According to our program 
* First Static block is executed then empty at last constructor
